**AI Orchestrator Script**
**Overview**
This Python script defines functions to orchestrate, delegate tasks to sub-agents, refine outputs, and create folder structures based on user objectives and interactions with AI models. It provides a conversational AI system using OpenAI's LM Studio API.
Parameters
**objective: **The main task or goal that the user wants to achieve. This can include a description of the task to be completed or a specific objective to work on.
**file_content:** Used to pass the content of a file to the opus_orchestrator function. This content is then displayed in the console output when the function is called.
**previous_results:** A list that contains the results of previous sub-tasks. This is used to pass the results of previous sub-tasks to the Orchestrator function so that it can consider them when breaking down the current objective into the next sub-task.
**use_search:** A boolean flag that determines whether to include a search query generation step in the process. When set to True, the system will prompt the Orchestrator to generate a JSON object containing a search query that can be used to gather relevant information for solving the sub-task. Defaults to False (optional).
**Functionality**
The provided code snippet implements a conversational AI system using OpenAI's LM Studio API. Here is a breakdown of the main functions and their purposes:
Usage
To use this script, you can start by defining your objective and providing any necessary file content or previous results. You can then call the opus_orchestrator function with these parameters to initiate the AI system's process. The system will then orchestrate the tasks, delegate sub-tasks to sub-agents, refine outputs, and create folder structures based on your objectives and interactions with AI models.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
OpenAI's LM Studio API
Installation
To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:
